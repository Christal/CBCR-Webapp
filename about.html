 <div class = 'cols2'>
    <p>Spaying/Neutering: We will not place intact rescue dogs in adoptive homes. Exceptions may be made for dogs judged physically unsuitable for immediate surgery: these dogs will be placed with a sterilization contract.</p>

    <p>It is our belief that spaying and neutering pet Border Collies benefits both the individual dog and the breed as a whole. The dog is less distracted and moody, avoids illness or death from reproductive disease and will not produce more unwanted dogs.</p>

    <p>Two hundred years of intelligent breeding have produced the finely-tuned combination of instinct and physique which is the Border Collie - and a few generations of careless breeding could destroy that work. We support spaying and neutering!
    Local Placement: We prefer to place dogs within reasonable driving distance of a Carolina Border Collie Rescue volunteer. We will not place dogs in homes without a face-to-face interview by a CBCR volunteer, except in extraordinary circumstances. No CBCR dog will be flown as part of the adoption process.</p>

    <p>We want to make it easy to continue communicating with our adoptive homes, since placing dogs is only part of our mission - the rest comes after adoption!
    Home Evaluations: CBCR, or a cooperating rescue, will do in person evaluation of all applicant homes. The evaluations are not just to protect the dog, but also to protect the applicant from the stress that can result from an inappropriate placement. The evaluator will try to get a feel for what kind of dog would work best in the applicant's home.</p>

    <p>Evaluators will not make any promises or judgments as to the likelihood of the applicant's ability to adopt a particular dog. Evaluators will make it clear that the CBCR foster home makes the final decision on the best home for their dogs. Volunteers will make it clear that CBCR will make the final decision on what dogs to offer the home.</p>

    <p>Forms are provided which will guide the evaluator in the process. Evaluations will be reviewed and approved by at least one other CBCR volunteer and the dog's foster home, or two volunteers if the dog is being placed from outside. The dog's foster volunteer has the most weight in any disagreement regarding the dog's placement, and retains the right of refusal.</p>

    <p>Fencing: CBCR does not have a policy on fencing. It is up to the foster home to determine if the type of fencing or lack of fencing, of a home, is suitable for the temperament of their particular dog. Please discuss the issue of fencing with the foster home of the dog you are interested in adopting.</p>

    <p>Owner Relinquished Dogs: CBCR is not a dog shelter. We do not have the facilities to take owner relinquishments, unless the dog is endangered. We can work with an owner to try to resolve behavior problems, and can help place the dog directly from its present home.
    Evaluating Rescued Dogs: We evaluate all dogs before accepting them into the CBCR program. Acceptable dogs should look relatively purebred. Most mixes can be placed very quickly through local all-breed rescue groups, while the same dog would languish for months in a breed-rescue program.</p>

    <p>We will consider potentially difficult-to-place dogs such as those with health or behavior problems on a case-by case basis. We have access to professional help with these dogs, but time and space are also factors of considerable weight. We do not accept aggressive dogs. CBCR representatives will make the final determination about a dog's acceptability for our program.
    Health Care: All CBCR rescues will be updated on basic vaccines and heartworm tested at least five days before any public appearance. Foster homes should also take care to keep dogs without medical histories isolated as much as possible from their own pets for the same period. Heartworm preventative is also required, after testing. Kennel cough vaccine is recommended but not presently required.</p>

    <p>Foster homes will keep records of all medical care. Before an adoption, two copies should be made of the records. One copy will be sent to the adoptive home, one retained by the foster home, and the original records should be sent to the CBCR treasurer.
    Fostering: Foster homes are the mainstay of any rescue program and should be treated as such! Every foster home should fill out a volunteer information form, including any restrictions on the care they can offer.</p>

    <p>This data will be used to ensure that foster homes are treated fairly and individuals are not over-used. We will take every step to respect the stated wishes of our foster homes. No individual dog is worth the many dogs that could be lost if a home is abused and refuses to work with us anymore!</p>

    <p>Potential foster homes will be evaluated exactly like an adoptive applicant. (ie, they will complete a foster home form, have a home visit and counseling from a CBCR volunteer.)</p>

    <p>Foster homes may adopt dogs they themselves are fostering by reimbursing any expenses incurred by CBCR, or another volunteer in that dog's rescue.
    Communication: We do the large part of our communication by e-mail, since it is cheap and usually reliable. Rescuers should reserve business-hour phone calls and e-mail for emergencies (except for those who only have access to e-mail during that time). Especially, keep in mind those who work from home.</p>

    <p>Personal problems with fellow volunteers should not be worked out through e-mail. Additionally, there is never a good reason to discuss a grievance with anyone other than the offending party. A friendly organization works more efficiently!
    Priorities: CBCR will keep in mind that volunteers have families and (we hope) social lives, as well as pets of their own. Rescuers will be encouraged to go on regular "vacations." Volunteers must look out for each other and make sure that no individual is bearing a load out of proportion, and that no one is spending all of his or her time, exclusively, on rescue activities.</p>
